/* This only works on Windows10 when the proton-style context menus are used.
 * Purpose of this style is to force either dark or light version of menus
 * regardless of the Firefox theme you have.
 * This does NOTHING unless you go to about:config and create a new number pref
 * "userchrome.menupopups.color-scheme"
 *
 * 0 = dark
 * 1 = light
